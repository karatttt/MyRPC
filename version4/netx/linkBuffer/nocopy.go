	//
	// The slice p is only valid until the next call to the Release method.
	// Next is not globally optimal, and Skip, ReadString, ReadBinary methods
	// are recommended for specific scenarios.

	// Slice returns a new Reader containing the Next n bytes from this Reader.
	//
	// If you want to make a new Reader using the []byte returned by Next, Slice already does that,
	// and the operation is zero-copy. Besides, Slice would also Release this Reader.
	// The logic pseudocode is similar:

	//  this.Release()
	//  return reader, err

//	Flush()
